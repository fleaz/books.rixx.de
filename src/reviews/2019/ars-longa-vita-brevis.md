[Ars Longa, Vita Brevis](<a target="_blank" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/09/ars-longa-vita-brevis/" rel="nofollow">https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/09...</a>) is not one of *Scott Alexander*'s best stories. Skippable, to me, because the content lost out against the style. (What is it with rationalist fiction and that stilted style? Can't people make an argument without sounding like badly written robot hybrids?)
