[It Was You Who Made My Blue Eyes Blue](<a target="_blank" href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/15/it-was-you-who-made-my-blue-eyes-blue/" rel="nofollow">http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/15/...</a>) is a rationalist short story by Scott Alexander, exploring the impact of logic and colonialisation on an island tribe. KIDDING! While technically correct, it is also false, and I can't tell you more than that without giving away the best part of the punch line. Go read it! It's not long, and a lot of fun, particularly the first half, before the smug rationalist author breaks through.
