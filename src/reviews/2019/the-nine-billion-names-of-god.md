[The Nine Billion Names of God](<a target="_blank" href="https://urbigenous.net/library/nine_billion_names_of_god.html" rel="nofollow">https://urbigenous.net/library/nine_b...</a>) is a short story fairly typical of the Arthur C. Clarke times of scifi. Doesn't hurt to read, but by now it's fairly predictable, and the premise was new then, but is kind of ehhh today.
