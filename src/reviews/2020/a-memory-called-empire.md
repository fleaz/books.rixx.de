A junior ambassador from one alien nation and planet to another, which boasts of a highly complex language and culture?
Finding herself scrambling to catch up with her predecessor (rudely murdered, instead of being in her brain as would be
appropriate), trying not to share his fate? Sudden conspiracies, even mor complex cultural games, plus an assistent
she's very much into? Hell yes. This was a lot of fun, and the fact that a lot of it is about xenolinguistics made it
even better.
