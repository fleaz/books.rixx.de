I think at this point (maybe earlier, but who knows) Dorothy Sayers had understood that her forte was in the characters and the dialogue, and WOW does she ever deliver. It's a honeymoon with a murder, of course, and I can't get over my love of the characters, so I won't even try.<br /><br />As always, interesting to see how society worked back then. Commentary on everywhere sexism is very intentional, while the Scot and the Jew collecting money are, ahem, less reflected.
