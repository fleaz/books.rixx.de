**The Mountains of Mourning** is a very touching **Vorkosigan** novella by *Lois McMaster Bujold*. It's deeply impressive to me how very emotional and touching this novella gets in under 150 pages, while still maintaining the character and tone of the overall series. Our favourite hero, Miles, confronts a backwater village while investigating a child murder. The crippled man confronting a society where killing crippled children is more than just tolerated â€“ and at no point Bujold goes for the easy way out. No good vs evil here, oh no, just heartbreak.
