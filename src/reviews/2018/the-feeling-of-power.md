[The Feeling of Power](<a target="_blank" href="https://urbigenous.net/library/power.html" rel="nofollow">https://urbigenous.net/library/power....</a>) by *Isaac Asimov* explores a world in which computers are everywhere, and humans have forgotten how to do anything by themselves, especially calculations. Not a novel concept, you may say, but the publication date is 1958. I'm completely undecided on if this has aged astonishingly well or has been made unreadable, but I'd say take the five minutes and read it regardless.
