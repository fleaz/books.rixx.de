# Welcome to log(book)!

This is where I valiantly try to keep track of

*   the [books Iâ€™ve read](/reviews/), and my opinions on them
*   what I'm [currently reading](/reading/)
*   which books [I want to read](/to-read/), and why.

The data gets synced to [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/rixx), but this site is the primary source. If you're
really interested in what I'm reading, you can [subscribe to the feed](/feed.xml).
